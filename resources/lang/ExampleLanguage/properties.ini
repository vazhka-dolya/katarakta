[PROPERTIES]
# In this property you need to write the name of this language's folder
# For example, if your language's folder is called "Polish", then you need
#  to also write "Polish" here (without quotes)
Properties_InnerName = ExampleLanguage

# Here you write the name of the language that will appear in the settings
# If you are translating to a certain dialect of that language, then
#  I suggest you to write that country's dialect in brackets
#  and also put that country's flag in that case
# Example:
#  Brazilian Portuguese would be called something like
#  "PortuguÃªs (Brasil)" (which translates to "Portuguese (Brazil)")
#  (also without quotes)
#  and have the Brazilian flag instead of the Portuguese one
Properties_Name = Example Language

# Here you put the name of the person or people that made the language
# If you used a machine translator and/or AI then you can also put that
#  translator's/AI's name here
# Separated by commas
# Example:
#  "DanilAstroid, DeepL Translator"
#  (as you might have understood already, you don't need to put quotes)

# This property shows if the language should be displayed or not
# If it's set to 1, then it will not be displayed
# If you're wondering why this property exists, it's specifically just for this
#  example so that it does not get displayed for the normal user.
# So, just replace that 1 with a 0
Properties_DoNotDisplay = 1

# If most/all of your translation was done using a machine translator or an AI,
#  set this to 1 for katarakta to display an icon that shows it.

# That's it for the properties.ini file, all text of katarakta is in text.ini
# I hope you have fun while translating!
