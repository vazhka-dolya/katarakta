SW_ToolTipPath1 = This is the path with the folders inside of which you put the «hi-res» textures that a graphics plugin can load over a game's original textures.<br>This path usually looks something like the following:<br><br>[path to your emulator]/Plugin/GFX/hires_texture/<br>or<br>[path to your emulator]/Plugin/hires_texture/<br>(you can create the "hires_texture" folder if you don't have it.)<br><br>You need to have a "/" (without quotes, obviously. "\" also works for Windows) in the end for katarakta to use the path correctly.
SW_ToolTipMainTextureNames1 = The textures you will be changing the most are going to probably be the eyes, the cap, the sidehair, the mustache and the button. The names for this kind of textures is the bunch of seemingly random symbols that go after the game's name, starting with and including the "#" as shown in the example below.
SW_ToolTipMainTextureNames2 = Though, the names for these seven textures are already included and it's extremely unlikely that you would ever have to change them.
SW_ToolTipGameNames1 = What I call a "game's name" is a name which—to my knowledge—is used for referring to a specific game and is contained inside the game's ROM. These «games' names» are also used by the «hi-res» textures and hence by katarakta. If the main ROM you are using is a normal Super Mario 64 ROM, then Super Mario 64's name is probably "SUPER MARIO 64" for you, which is already included. Places where a game's name can be found include but are not limited to:<br>• The emulator's "save" folder, specifically the .eep files inside;<br>• The folder where a game's textures are dumped when dumping textures with a graphics plugin.<br>BUT! The name your emulator can show as its window title can sometimes be incorrect, so do not rely on that.
SW_ToolTipGameNames2 = You can add names for other games if you are planning to change textures there too (separated by semicolons (";") without spaces before or after the semicolons).<br>After adding any other games, you can choose which other game to apply a texture to using the button with an arrow facing down on it next to the Apply button:
